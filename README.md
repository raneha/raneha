# Hi, I'm Neha Rane! 👋  
**Data Analyst | Business Analyst**

## 📌 About Me

I’m a data-driven analyst passionate about transforming raw data into meaningful insights that support smarter business decisions. I enjoy working end-to-end on data projects — from data cleaning and SQL querying to building interactive dashboards and presenting insights clearly.

My strengths lie in **SQL-based analysis**, **Power BI dashboarding**, and **Excel automation**, with hands-on experience across real-world datasets like healthcare, hotel performance, and retail analytics. I focus on accuracy, clarity, and business relevance in everything I build.

I’m continuously learning and improving my skills in **data modeling, KPI design, and storytelling with data**, while exploring cloud and analytics engineering.
